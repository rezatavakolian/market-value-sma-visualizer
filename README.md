## Overview
This project provides a minimal yet extensible workflow for detecting and visualizing **bullish SMA crossovers**.  
It fetches market data from an API, computes simple moving averages (SMA), and generates annotated plots that highlight crossover signals.

### Features
-  **API Fetching** – Pulls time-series market data seamlessly  
-  **SMA Calculation** – Computes short- and long-term moving averages  
-  **Bullish Cross Detection** – Flags golden cross events (short SMA crossing above long SMA)  
-  **Visualization** – Produces clear, publication-ready plots with crossover markers  

### Use Cases
- Quick signal prototyping for trading strategies  
- Educational demos on moving averages and crossovers  
- Lightweight visualization tool for market analysis  

### Tech Stack
- **Python** (async-friendly, modular design)  
- **pandas** for data wrangling  
- **matplotlib** / **plotly** for visualization
